                <h3>The Black Hole Guitar</h3>
                <p>The Black Hole Guitar is our original guitar that everyone wants. the guitar came to life over the
                    last few years, with a single creator behind the design.
                    With its custom inlays fretmarkers, to the handbuilt body, what is there not to love about this
                    guitar?
                </p>
                <p>The Guitar has a lot to offer with its large custamization that we are working very hard to offer to
                    you. The guitar id not limited to any genra either,
                    the guitar was desinged with many genras in mind. From the blues to death metal to lofi, the guitar
                    will find its place very nicely.
                </p>
                <p>The neck humbucker is ideal for the classic sounds of lofi, and if your feeling the blues, out push
                    pull pots alow you to use only a single coil
                    pick to get that classic blues sound. The bridge pickup is nice and dirty, ideal for heavy rock when
                    the gain is cranked but will play very clean low. Same
                    with the neck pickup, the bridge has a push pull pot aswell alowing you to get a more classic strat
                    sound from the 80's
                </p>
