            <h3>Built in effect pedals.</h3>
            <p>One of the things that we are doing here at Gorka Guitars is giving you the option to add a small custom 
                built pedal into your guitar, so that you dont need to have a pedal on the ground everywhere you 
                go and you can just toggle it with the flip of a switch on the guitar or the spin of a knob.
            </p>

            <h3>The PLEK system</h3>
            <p>The plek system is a machine that with intenonte the guitar to such precise margin of errers that no 
                human can replicate. This machine allows us to provide you with gutars that all are perfectly intenonted 
                so that you can play any note and it sounds perfect. It also removes high frets which can cause fret buzz.
                This gives you the best possible playing experince.
            </p>

            <h3>Indavidual pick up control</h3>
            <p>Much like you might find on bass's, we offer you the ablility to change the volume output of every single 
                pick up on the guitar. This lets you go from having a guitar that has only humbuchers on your guitar, 
                to sounding like theres only single coil pickups. This also acts as a way to change the distortion output 
                of your guitar when your playing with the volume cranked, the more you lean towards a single coil, the cleaner
                but this will let you get all the sounds that are inbetween that point.
